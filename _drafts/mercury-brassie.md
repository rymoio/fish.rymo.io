The Mercury Brassie is similar in look to the Mercury Blood Midge, however it has a completely wire based abdomen like a Copper John. Again, I like the simplicity of this fly along with the ability to go really small for picky fish.

You can tie this in other colors as well - red, chartreuse, blue, black, and green are all options.

The hardest part of this fly was getting the clipped ends of the wire to fold down nicely due to the lack of a threaded abdomen. I ended up using my scissors to push the ends behind the bead head and around the bend of the hook.
