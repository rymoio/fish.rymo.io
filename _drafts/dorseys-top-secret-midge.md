Pat Dorsey's Top Secret Midge pattern is a great trailing fly when fishing Colorado tailwaters like Cheesman and Eleven Mile. It's small size makes it attractive to selective fish, and the simplicity of the pattern means you can tie it very easily.

One tip that wasn't in Pat's tailwater book that I think makes a huge difference in the appearance of the fly is to use two bobbins for this fly - one for the brown and one for the white thread. Having the white thread on a bobbin allows you to really cord up the thread (spinning the bobbin clockwise) before wrapping the segmentation on the body.
