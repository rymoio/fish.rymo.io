The Fishpond 360 Retractor Swivel Zinger is an amazing product. Yes, it's a bit over priced, but that didn't stop me from buying three for my hip pack. Why do I like these so much? Simple - they don't suck like cord retractor zingers. I also love the pin attachment technology - it fits in the holes of my pack nicely and never comes loose. If you don't use these - you should.
