The Fishpond Nomad net is the perfect trout fishing net for wading. In my group of fishing buddies, we have three between the four of us. That means this net speaks for itself.

The net material is rubber so it's better for the fish, and doesn't get hooked on small flies as easy. The handle floats the net and also has a great coating on it that seems to hold better once your hands are wet. And lastly, the extra length on the handle is perfect for netting fish by yourself - and it also doubles as a measuring tape for those hogs you land.
