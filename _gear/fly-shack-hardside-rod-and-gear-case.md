At the moment, I live in a smaller condo which is lacking any real storage options, so I was storing my fishing gear in a laundry basket and my [hip pack]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _gear/simms-headwaters-guide-hip-pack.md %}). This was becoming a pain, and it also made it really hard to put my wet boots and waders in the laundry basket (which is what I originally bought that for).

This pack is great. It easily holds two 4-piece rod tubes (maybe even a third?), multiple reels, and all of my extra fly boxes. There is also room for other odds and ends that I don't need on my person for every trip. I also like that this is not a soft case, as it offers more protection when you toss it in the back of the Outback.
