I was able to get a steal of a deal on this rod at Backcountry.com a few years ago, and it was likely one of the best decisions I've made in terms of my fishing setup. This rod is high quality and works really nicely with my [Orvis Hydros Large Arbor II reel]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _gear/orvis-large-arbor-reel.md %}).

The moderate-fast action on this shorter and lighter rod makes it a great setup for small river nymphing and dry flying. It also proves helpful when navigating through brush and steep banks, as I don't have to worry about the length of a 9 or 10 foot rod getting caught in branches and bramble.

This rod casts very accurately over both short and medium distances. That comes in very handy when you have clear water and fish that easily spook like we have here in Colorado. This isn't the best rod to toss big streamers or shoot long distances. I've had to huck some small flies into the wind with this rod at Eleven Mile Canyon, and waking up the next morning is not a fun shoulder experience.

If you're in the market for a small stream rod with accurate casting and a more classic action, give this rod a try. I love it!
