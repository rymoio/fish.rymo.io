The drag is smooth, the retrieve is fast, and the craftsmanship is top notch. If you haven't used an Orvis reel before, I would highly recommend it. The color selections are also pretty nice. I have the II in Silver, and my father has the II in Gold.

I don't believe the model I have is available anymore, but Orvis released an SL (Super Large) version that looks really nice. If you're looking for a mid-priced reel for tailwater trout fishing, it's worth a look!
