The Mercury RS2 by Pat Dorsey is a required fly in anyone's fly box when fishing in Colorado. With all the variations you can create using colors, sizes, beads, and materials, you can also get pretty creative with how you tie it.

The two most prominent colors are gray and black, however you can also tie this in olive. You also have the option of tying the Bob Churchill Sparkle Wing RS2, which uses Pearl Braid for the wing.

I really like tying this particular fly, however as a beginner, I find that my first handful of RS2s have longer tails and thicker dubbed bodies than they should. I'll have to continue working on my dubbing technique to get it thinner and more uniform across flies.
