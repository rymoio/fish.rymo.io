excerpt: This was my first fly to tie out of my Pat Dorsey tailwater book, and it's a great pattern to throw at Cheesman or Deckers.

The Mercury Blood Midge pattern is another relatively simple pattern to tie. The two biggest challenges are likely that this pattern needs to be tied small, and that peacock herl can sometimes unexpectedly snap off - especially when you are just about to finish the fly and whip finish. The key to a nice, even body on this fly is to go slow on your wraps up and down the body, and to not overload the thread near the head.

You can also tie this fly in black, olive, or olive-brown depending on the hatch and location you are fishing.

I had a lot of fun tying this simple fly - I just wish I had more hook options. I was only able to tie #18 and #22.
