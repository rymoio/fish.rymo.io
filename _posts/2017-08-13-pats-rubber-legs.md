Not much to say about this fly. If you fish in Colorado, you need to have a half dozen of these on your person every time you go out. These will get big fish to bite, and can help get smaller flies down in the water column.

The beauty of this particular way of tying the pattern is the UV resin to hold down the legs. It makes tying this fly faster, and ensures your legs won't move.
