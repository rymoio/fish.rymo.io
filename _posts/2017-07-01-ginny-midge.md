The Ginny Midge pattern is a great trailing fly in a multi-fly nymphing rig. It's small size makes it attractive to selective fish, and the flash of the body and wing are often enough to entice a hit.

I actually didn't have any flashabou handy, so I used large pearl tinsel instead. The result was that my body and wings are a bit big for the hook size I tied.
