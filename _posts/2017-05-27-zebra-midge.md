excerpt: I haven't tied flies in years - really since tying some crazy saltwater patterns with my father - so getting back into it was fun and a bit addicting!

The Zebra Midge pattern is one of the simplest patterns to tie; however, given it's small hook size, it can be a challenge for your first fly pattern. As you can see with the image below, my wraps were a bit messy, and hit the hook barb with my wraps which frayed some of the thread.

I was able to crank out a number of these in a short amount of time, however my one piece of advice is to limit the number of wraps of the silver wire. I got a bit carried away on my first few flies and instead of looking like body segments, it looked like the entire fly was silver.

You can also tie this fly in red using gold or copper wire, and you can also substitute a mercury bead for the tungsten.
